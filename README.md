# Life OS ðŸ§­

An integrated personal management system designed to track and align goals, habits, finances, and personal growth into a single, cohesive application.

## Core Philosophy

This project is an experiment in "systems thinking" applied to personal development. Instead of using multiple disconnected apps, Life OS is being built from the ground up on a custom MySQL database to create a single source of truth for all aspects of life.

The system is designed around 10 core principles:
1.  **Personal Growth**
2.  **Value Creation**
3.  **Time Management**
4.  **Goals**
5.  **Feedback**
6.  **Finances**
7.  **Relationships**
8.  **Habit**
9.  **Household Management**
10. **Creativity & Hobbies**

## System Architecture

The application is built on a modular database schema, with each module representing a core function of the "Life OS":

* **Direction To Destination**: Manages high-level goals and the habits required to achieve them.
* **Execution**: Handles the day-to-day projects and tasks.
* **Growth**: Tracks skills, learning resources, and ideas.
* **Maintenance**: Manages finances, relationships, and household needs.
* **Guidance**: A system for capturing and applying feedback.

## Technology Stack

* **Database**: MySQL
* **Backend**: [Future: API in Python/Node.js/etc.]
* **Frontend**: [Future: Web Interface]
* **Desktop**: [Future: C++ Application]

## Current Status

The project is currently in the initial database design and implementation phase. The `goals` and `habits` tables for the "Direction To Destination" module are being built.
